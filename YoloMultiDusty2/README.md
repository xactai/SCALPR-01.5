## Multithread IMOU camera interface 

### A dynamic array of IMOU RTSP cameras on an NVIDIA board like the Jetson Nano.
ðŸ‘‰ please read the explanation at [YoloMultiDusty](https://github.com/xactai/SCALPR-01.5/tree/main/YoloMultiDusty) first. This repo is the sequel.<br><br>
The first study, YoloMultiDusty, showed that multithreading is the best solution for connecting multiple RTSP cameras to a Jeston board.
When a dedicated NVIDIA pipeline is used, the CPU and GPU are under minimal load. This provides the necessary space for other (computer intensive) algorithms such as deep learning or object tracking.<br><br>
This repo is the follow-up to this. The settings file has been replaced by a json script. In addition, preparations have been made to easily apply deep learning in the future.
The different cameras live in a dynamic array. There is no limit to the number. Only the board resources, like memory, are the limitation.<br><br>

## Config.json.
All required settings are listed in the `config.json` file. Without this file, the app will not work.

#### STREAMS_NR
Give the number of used streams. Can be any figure, there is no hard-coded limitation.<br> 
However, keep in mind the available resources.
#### STREAM_x
Define your input for flow x here. The number of stream_ must be at least equal to the number of streams given above.
#### CAM_NAME
For your convenience, you can give the RTSP stream a readable name.
#### VIDEO_INPUT
Select your video input. It can be one of the sources listed under `VIDEO_INPUTS_PARAMS`:<br>
`file, movie, usbcam, raspberrycam, remote_cam or remote_hls_gstreamer`.<br>
Default choice is an RTSP video stream.
#### VIDEO_INPUTS_PARAMS
| Item      | Description |
| --------- | -----|
| image  | Name and location of the picture. It must be a jpg or png file. |
| folder  | Directory containing the pictures. They must be jpg or png. |
| video | Name and location of the video file. |
| usbcam  | The GStreamer pipeline connecting the ALPR to an USB camera. |
| CSI1 | The GStreamer pipeline connecting the ALPR to an MIPI camera (port 0). |
| CSI2 | The GStreamer pipeline connecting the ALPR to an MIPI camera (port 1). |
| CCTV | The GStreamer pipeline connecting the ALPR to an RTSP source. |
| remote_hls_gstreamer | The GStreamer pipeline connecting the ALPR to an HLS source. |
#### WORK_WIDTH, WORK_HEIGHT
Define the size of the frames that the ALPR will use.<br>
It may be smaller than the RTSP streams received. Smaller resolutions require fewer resources, which increases processing speed. Or more cameras can be connected.<br>
On the other hand, the images cannot be chosen too small because the number plate will still have to be legible. Remember, the darknet model for the license plates works with [352x128](https://github.com/xactai/SCALPR-01.5/tree/main/YoloMultiDusty#this-repo-examines-rtsp-streams-with-nvidia-boards-like-the-jetson-nano) pixels.<br>
Frames larger than the camera resolution are processed, but do not add anything to the accuracy. They will only slow down the performance.
#### THUMB_WIDTH, THUMB_HEIGHT
The individual images are merged into an overview that is displayed on the screen. The individual size and height of these thumbnails are given here.
#### MJPEG_PORT
The port number of the local host to which the composed video is streamed. It is not possible to send the individual images.
#### DNN_Rect
Most deep learning models work with square images. Images from the IMOU camera have an aspect ratio of 16:9.
These have been reduced to a square. This causes distortion. Especially fast lightweight models such as YoloX or YoloFastest are sensitive to these artifacts. They recognize fewer objects.
With the parameters of DNN_Rect a section can be sent to the model.<br><br>
